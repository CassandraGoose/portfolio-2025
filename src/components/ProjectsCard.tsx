          I have had the opportunity to work on several production applications
          in my career. I have worked for product companies and also worked for
          a consultancy, where I worked on various teams and with various
          technologies.

            I delivered the bulk of the functionality as the only front end
            developer on the team, which was tasked with creating a dashboard
            for users to explore logs and edit personel. While the functionality
            was largely CRUD-based, I had to make decisions to not only ensure
            the longevity of the code but also deliver on-pace with expected
            deadlines, which were extremely tight. I balanced delivering quick
            features with testing, performance, security, and error tracking.

            I worked on a team of 2 developers, one product manager, and mental
            health staff from the client company to create a wizard style
            application to quickly allow users to access mental health
            assistance, particularly during crisis events. This full-stack
            application allowed for users to directly communicate with potential
            providers, book appointments, and find care. This project was HIPAA
            compliant.

            As one of two developers, I was challenged with delivering much of
            the functionality which involved interfacing with the client company
            APIs and SMTP. I utilized JSS to style the application according to
            the client company's design specs. I often paired with the other
            developer on particularly challenging sections of the application
            and we reviewed each other's code. I continually delivered my
            stories fully tested and cleaned on time for each sprint. I also got
            the opportunity to not only present my work to the clients every
            sprint, but also brainstorm with the clients to uncover the features
            their users needed.

            I acted as a tech lead for a team of 4 developers, one product
            manager, and the client company to create a wizard style career
            finder which utilized a psychology-based algorithm to match users to
            a set of careers. This application also contained a tracker for high
            school students to prepare for college.

            I was tasked with reviewing code from the other 3 developers, acting
            as architect, completing features, and mentoring the other
            developers. I continually identified and fixed issues and worked to
            future-proof the application. I implemented continuous integration
            and deployment for this project, as well. I inherited this
            application in its early life and identified some security issues
            and also noted that the API was not RESTful. After creating a
            refactor proposal and presenting it to stakeholders, the team spent
            2 sprints fixing the vulnerabilities and set the application up so
            that future work would be much more seamless and fast.

            We worked closely with a group of users to design helpful tooling

            perform calculations in a serverless situation.

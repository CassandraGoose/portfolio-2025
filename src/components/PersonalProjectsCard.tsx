            This project was designed to help learners track their progress and
            reach their goals. It can be difficult to know if you have mastered
            a concept or not. This tool allows users to share objective-based
            learning plans and resources and also track the courses and work
            they have completed in order to better know if mastery or
            proficiency has been achieved.

            This site acts as a portfolio site for the metal artist Terry
            Lawrenz. I made some interesting choices here, so that the artist
            could easily make updates with technology he was already comfortable
            using. For example, instead of utilizing a CMS or a database, I have
            data coming in from a Google Sheet. I'm hoping to improve the
            Largest Contentful Paint, compress images, and generally improve the
            performance of the application in the future.

            Once upon a time, I was pretty dang good with D3 and worked on some
            visualization applications for various companies. I'm really rusty,
            so I wanted to get my chops back. This project is a playground to do
            just that. Utilizing data from NUFORC's database of reported UFO
            sightings, I am building various visualizations to tell a story
            about the data. I hope to make the site responsive and accessible
            moving forward, along with adding more charts.

            I really wanted to get proficient with TailwindCSS. I also haven't
            built any complex CSS in a few years. So, I decided to make a
            Domino's clone (based on Domino's October, 2023 website) so that I
            could get comfortable with layouts, designs, etc. I need to fix a
            couple of items, but ultimately, I think this site shows that I can
            match a design quite well.
